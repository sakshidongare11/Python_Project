# Speech Recognition System 

The Speech Recognition System is a Python-based application that converts spoken language into text. This project demonstrates the use of speech-to-text technology, enabling voice commands or dictation functionalities. It utilizes libraries such as SpeechRecognition, PyAudio, and optionally gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for voice interaction.

The system captures audio input from the user using a microphone and processes it using APIs like Google Web Speech API, converting it into text and displaying or saving the output. It can also respond to certain commands, making it useful for voice assistants, accessibility tools, or voice-controlled automation systems.
